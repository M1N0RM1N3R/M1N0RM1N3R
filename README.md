# `log.info("What is up, I am PickSquid...")`

I'm a recovering Splatoon addict turned circle clicker who cobbles together random tools from time to time to help make my life easier.
I also publish those tools here from time to time in the hopes that they can make yours easier too.
It can also ease the mind to know that my applications won't go spying on you. Have a look around--the proof is in the ~~pudding~~source code.

## üë®‚Äçüíª What am I up to?

### Rebranding

I've really gotten into this whole [osu!](https://github.com/ppy/osu) thing over the past couple months.
I'm now clearing maps I was struggling through in my sleep (not literally) and I beat my first 5-star recently.
I've been meaning to rebrand to a less "1337-ified because my original one was taken" name for a while now, and PickSquid--which is my username on osu!--might just be it.
My NSO subscription also lapsed recently, and I honestly don't know whether I will keep it, if even to play in the last Splatfest(s) of Splatoon 3.

## üí¨ How to get in touch with me?

### Discord for fastest response, email may also work

I'm almost always active on Discord, so if you need a somewhat quick response, that's the best place to get it--even if it's just to draw my attention to an email you sent me. Please don't waste my time, and read [this](https://nohello.net) (flashbang warning btw) before sliding into my DMs.
Email may also work to drop me a line if Discord's a no-go, and I'll get to it if/when I catch a glimpse of your message while rummaging through my inbox for a 2FA code, verification link, or what-have-you.

## üîú What am I planning?

### Giving NixOS another shot

I've been working on a completely new NixOS configuration, and I'm planning on giving NixOS another install once I get it set up to my satisfaction.
I'm currently using `nixos-generate` on my current Pop!_OS system to build live ISOs to test in a VM for rapid iteration before taking the plunge again.
For some reason, `home-manager` doesn't seem to jive with Pop!_OS--as soon as it was activated, system apps and services kept segfaulting until I uninstalled it.
The rewrite branch is not currently published--hell, there aren't even any commits yet!

## üìö What am I learning?

### ...that I'll probably have to do a Windows dual-boot to play Strinova

For those of you not in the know, Strinova is a new tactical TPS that is finally breaking out of China.
Coming from Splatoon, its paper-thin shape-shifting mechanic looks to have a lot of potential, if not for one major issue as far as I'm concerned:
The game (as of now) only (officially) supports Windows, and thanks to a kernel-level client-side anti-cheat, people such as myself have been having a helluva time trying to get past the **launcher**.
As a full-time Linux user who gives some semblance of a crap about my privacy, even if I did manage to dual-boot Windows, letting a directly Chinese-owned program have root access to my system kind of sketches me out. Vanguard--for VALORANT--was a stretch back before I joined the penguin side, since Tencent has majority stake in Riot.

## üß† What's in the back of my head?

### An as-of-yet unnamed SurrealDB ODM

SurrealDB is one of the coolest databases I've ever seen.
I'm thinking about creating a strongly-typed ODM for SurrealDB on top of [Pydantic](https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic), in a similar vein to [Beanie](https://github.com/roman-right/beanie) (my new favorite data modelling library for MongoDB, which I'm using in [Kolkra-NG](https://github.com/m1n0rm1n3r/kolkra-ng)) and [SQLModel](https://github.com/tiangolo/sqlmodel).
My first problem is one that's notoriously one of the two hardest things in computer science next to cache invalidation...I don't have a good name for it that wasn't already yoinked on PyPI. Drop me a line if you have any ideas. ü§î
